An attempt to calculate the Fourier-transformed density weighted
velocity moments, and the resulting resummed redshift-space power spectrum.

This code is based upon the Halo-Zeldovich code in this same repository,
see their README for more details.

This code requires NumPy and SciPy and makes use of the
"multiplicative convolutional fast integral transforms"
library:

which you will need to install.
