The Gaussian streaming model and Convolution Lagrangian effective field theory

JCAP 12(2016)007, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02908]

The code is written (mostly) in C++.  It can be run from the command line, or
called from Python (wrappers provided).

This version only implements the configuration-space statistics
(i.e. the correlation function).
