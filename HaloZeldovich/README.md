# Halo-Zeldovich power spectrum code

Python(3) code to compute the Halo-Zeldovich power spectrum of biased
tracers, as described in Appendix B of Modi, White & Vlah (2017):

Modi, White & Vlah, JCAP, submitted.

This code can be used to model the real-space auto- and cross-correlations
of biased tracers at large scales and high redshift, for example in modeling
cross-correlations of galaxies or quasars and CMB lensing.
